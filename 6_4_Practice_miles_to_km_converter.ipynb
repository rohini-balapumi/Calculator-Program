        "### Simple version\n",
        "Write a program that prompts the user to enter a distance in miles and converts that distance to kilometers. The program should use the following conversion formula: 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers. The program should then display the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Extended version:\n",
        "The run tracker program is designed to help users keep track of their runs. Users can enter the date, distance in miles, and time in minutes for each run they complete. The program then automatically converts the distance in miles to kilometers and calculates the speed in kilometers per hour using the conversion formula 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers. The information, including all input values and the calculated speed, is then saved to a CSV file named 'run.csv' for later analysis or tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "The program is user-friendly and interactive. It prompts the user to enter the required information and provides clear feedback, including a confirmation message with the values entered by the user and the calculated speed. The program also allows the user to decide whether to continue entering more runs or terminate the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the run tracker program is a useful tool for individuals who want to monitor their running progress over time and make data-driven decisions about their training."
